# Gen-AI (on-going project)
As Junior Data Scientest at BCG's GenAI Consulting team - My role focused on applying AI and data analysis skills to develop AI-powered tools, such as a financial chatbot, while learning to translate complex data into strategic business insights collaborating with a senior data scientest at BCG who integrates AI with financial analytics for strategic consulting solutions.

Objective:
 - Develop AI-powered chatbot that analyzes financial documents
 - Here I apply my technical expertise in AI and data analysis while also learning about the financial domain.
 - My primary objective is to extract and analyze key financial data from the client's 10-K and 10-Q documents.
 - This involves understanding financial statements, identifying significant trends, and preparing data for AI-driven applications.
 - Following the data analysis, an AI-powered financial chatbot is to be developed.
 - This chatbot must be capable of analyzing financial data and providing insights that effectively communicate complex financial information in an interactive and user-friendly manner.
 - Throughout the project, my focus will not only be on the technical execution but also on how these AI-driven insights can be leveraged in a consulting context to provide strategic recommendations and solutions to clients.
