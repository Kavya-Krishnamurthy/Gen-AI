PROJECT Brief:
-  Time to build the AI-powered financial chatbot for GFC.
-  This tool will transform the raw data I've worked on into interactive, insightful conversations.
-  Task is to integrate the analyzed data into the chatbot's framework, making sure it can interpret and relay financial insights effectively."
- This is a hands-on challenge during which both my coding skills and my understanding of the financial data will be put to the test.


**Principles of AI chatbot development**
- As we delve into AI chatbot development, it's crucial to grasp the foundational principles that make chatbots effective communicators and problem solvers.
- At its core, a chatbot is designed to simulate a conversation with human users.
- For our financial chatbot, this means that the AI should understand and respond to queries about financial data in a way that feels natural and helpful.

1. Rule-based logic:
     - Start by implementing rule-based responses.
     - This means our chatbot will use predetermined responses to specific queries.
     - Think of it as a sophisticated "if-then" logic: if the user asks "X," then the chatbot responds with "Y."
     - This approach is ideal for handling frequently asked questions about financial data.

2. State management:
    -  Even in a simple chatbot, managing the conversation's state is important.
    -  This involves remembering the context of the conversation or the user's previous queries to make responses more          relevant and personalized.

3. Error handling:
    - Prepare our chatbot to handle unrecognized queries gracefully.
    - It should inform users when it doesn't understand a question and guide them towards queries that it can respond to.
